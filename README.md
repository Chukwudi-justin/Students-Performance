# This project seeks to visually answer the following question as regards students performance in a test:
*Number of student by gender and student performance in the test by gender.\
*The ethnic group with the highest number of student participation.\
*Highest level of education attained by most parent.\
*Relationship between lunch/student meal and student performance.\
*Test preparation course and student test performance.\
*Influence of race/ethnicity, parental level of education on students performance.
